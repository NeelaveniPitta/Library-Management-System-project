## ðŸ“š Library Management System â€“ Spring Boot Web Application

The **Library Management System** is a **Spring Boot-based** web application developed using **Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, and MySQL/Oracle**. The application manages **students, books, and issue/return records** in a systematic way.  

The workflow is simple: first, students and books are added, then a book can be issued to a student, and finally returned. The bookâ€™s availability status is **automatically updated** upon return. The backend uses **Spring Boot controllers and repositories** to handle requests and database operations, while the frontend uses **Thymeleaf HTML templates** such as `add-student.html`, `books.html`, and `issue-book.html`.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Manage students (add, update, delete)  
- Manage books (add, update, delete)  
- Issue books to students  
- Return books with automatic availability update  
- Track issue history  

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA  
- **Frontend:** Thymeleaf (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)  
- **Database:** MySQL / Oracle  
- **Architecture:** MVC Pattern
